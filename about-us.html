        BBC Finance—short for Big Boys Club—is on a mission to make stock trading more accessible to everyone. Founded by a singularly passionate developer, August Andersson the 17th, BBC Finance builds clean, simple tools that cut through the noise and empower everyday people to understand and participate in the stock market. <br><br>

        We believe trading shouldn’t require a finance degree or hours of research. That’s why our tools are designed to be straightforward, intuitive, and actually helpful—so you can focus on making smart moves, not learning jargon.<br><br>
        
        At BBC Finance, it’s not about being flashy—it’s about being effective. Welcome to the club.
